PositionConstraint
------------------
Need to make sure that the constraint bounds are a subset of the state space bounds.
This should be straightforward to do.


ConstraintInformation
---------------------
Currently not possible to see if two constraints affect the same portion of
the StateSpace.  Maybe make SubstateLocation required for Constraint base.
Then it is easy to see if two Constraints affect the same subspace.


SpaceInformation
----------------
Consider extending base::SpaceInformation.  Add ConstrainedSpaceInformation and
add the ConstraintInformation ptr to it directly.
